Build a claims lifecycle for UK banks by automating manual, administrative tasks, starting with the claims intake process (V1). This phased approach will progressively improve the customer experience by reducing claim resolution time through automation, transparency, and faster communication.
It will also empower claims managers by providing them with an easy assessment of claim validity and the necessary tools (V2) to focus on complex, high-value cases. Ultimately, the system will increase claims accuracy and operational efficiency by moving towards a fully autonomous claims process for straightforward cases (V3), allowing human expertise to be applied where it is most needed.

The system automatically processes multimodal inputs (documents, images, text) to extract key information, performs a basic Section 75 eligibility check, and routes the claim to the correct claims manager.For initial stage just access the files and store in the local drive. It generates a claim ID and stores the case in the database.

1. Claim summary
2. Supporting evidences(these are attachments that will be stored in the local drive)
3. Eligibility check
